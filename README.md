This is an App made for Codaisseur to Evaluate students.

Each student has been evaluated with either green, yellow or red. They are by default red, when they haven't had any evaluation yet.

I built an algorithm that sorts the students based on their last evaluation, their teacher can then click the Random Student button and will have a 49% chance of asking a question from a 'red' student, 33% chance for a 'yellow' and 18% for a 'green' student.

Run it with 'yarn install' and 'yarn start', you also need to clone the Backend for this App : https://github.com/AMiloudi/EvaluationTool-API
Yarn seed is needed if you don't have any data to insert yet.

On this screen you see all the batches and you can add new batches/classes.
